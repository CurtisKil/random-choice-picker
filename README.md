## Project Title

Random Choice Picker

## Purpose

As a new developer, I want to do a daily coding project tutorial to learn new features and deepen my understanding of Web Development.

## Description

This project helps a user make a random choice. The user enters all the choices they would like and when they press enter the app will run an animation with the choices and then make a choice for the user.
